### Initial Kirsty visit to mum.

Kirsty called Silverchain. Has appt with mum 6jan26 contingent on clearance scabies letter from GP.

### Mum assigned ftntly home care 1.5hr visit

Karla(?) assigned home care try to keep same 1 or 2 to build trust/relationship.  Bed costs no go as OT needs 2 b involved, get two quotes blahblah.

### Nutrition issues, Meals on Wheels

Discussed nutritional concerns. Not always having meals or properly balanced meals.  I shared my concern that meals were not always being taken, i.e., not prepared, or that meals lacked in nutritional value; i.e., they were too small or lacking in vegetables/proteins/carbs.

Kirsty confirmed that payments for MoW meals are coming from Aged Care Package as she has instructed MoW to send invoices to her.  This explains the absence of transactions for $36 coming out of any of mum's bank accts or VISA.

Kirsty will email me in future in first instance so I can stay informed.  I can share with mum any information I feel needs sharing.  This puts me better in the loop as to what's happening and removes the burden of managing her affairs for mum.  It also removes the 'Chinese whispers' aspect of past communications or holes in information (cf MoW payments).

## On the issue of reimbursement for mechanical bed.

Kirsty explained (apologetically) that for a purchase like this to happen it needs to follow the prescribed method which is to have an OT visit, then submit two quotes for the item to MAC, and then, if approved, have the provider make the purchase using MAC available funds.
