While at Cooroora Place I called Kirsty to catch up and make sure we were both at the same page.  Kirsty confirmed that absent a letter of clearance from scabies from Desh, the home helper woould not be coming around.  Mum then announced that she did not want or need home help.  Kirsty said she intended to send a form for Evelyn to complete so mum could be compensated for costs spent on using Evelyn as cleaner.

Mum initially balked at this as she felt Evelyn would not have a ABN number and mum thought there would be a charge for taxes as part of this arrangement.  Later today we dropped some furniture off to Evelyn and mum raised the issue with her - Evelyn said she would be happy the review the form and if she could she was happy to fill it out.

I will need to email or call Kirsty with this change of plans tomorrow.

The only other item was Kirsty advising that of any unspent home package alocation in a given month only $1k would be rolled over into the next month.  That is to say if mum does not take advantage of the allocated funds, she will have unased portion returned to the Australian Government.

After several mised calls on both our parts had lengthy discusion with **Joan** from Nabour Community Health this afternoon.  Seems Joan was performing a follow up call after speaking with mum yesterday(?) and mum saying she should talk with me.

Advised Joan that mum was indeed aware that Nambour Hospital and Nambour Community Health would not be paying for any incontinence pants for mum; we'd been told as much by staff at SCUH when mum was last released following apendectomy.

Joan seemed interested in knowing if there was any follow up care they **could** provide for mum as well as confirming curent engagement of Silverchain as aged care provider and the fact that mum was a Level3 Home Care Package recipient.  When Joan raised the prospect of an at-home call by a specialist in Parkinsons and how to manage etc I suggested this would be beneficial but to discuss it with mum.  Joan will do so.

Asked Joan to email the details of this specialist if she could - she said she has no mobile(!) but might be able to get a staffer to email this or text this to me.  A pleasant and seemingly competent woman to deal with.
