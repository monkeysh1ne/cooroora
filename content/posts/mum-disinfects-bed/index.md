So spent most of day with mum and Bryson.  Both went down for nap after 12-12:30pm lunch.  Was thinking to clean main toilet floor couldn't find spray bottle of disinfectant.  Mum's bedroom door ajar and saw it on walker tray. Wondered why but thought nothing more and didn't want to disturb.

Short while later mum cam into lounge where I was on computer with spray bottle still on walker.  I asked why.  She said she had sprayed her bed with it.  I exclaimed that this was not a product you should be spraying on your bed.  Read through warnings and clearly stated skin irritant, keep clear of eyes and mouth.  Asked mun if she had read the bottle - no, only saw that it killed 99% of germs.

I changed mum's sheet and sniffed pillows - no descernable odor of bleach. Put bleach dosed sheet in laundry.

I explained to Bryson before I left what had happened and that I was concerned that if mum could do this what next?  He will place remaining chemicals etc beyond her reach.  Very concerned here that mum is becoming incapable of looking after herslef and may well be putting herself in harms way/ heightened risk.

Called sis and discussed.  Call GP soonest as another cognitive test may be best next step.  If GP won't listen to me then maybe POA needs to get involved -  see where that gets us (personaly, suspect nowhere).   Neither can feed themselves and not entirely sure meds being taken in correct order at correct times.

Mum sounds like she may have been re-infected with scabaies.  Suggested call in carpet clearer guy and have entire house done plus upholstery.  Remove mattress and burn or otherwise destroy/remove from property.
