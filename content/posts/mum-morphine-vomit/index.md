## Mum throws up several times 16Jan26

Yesterday, when Bryson, mum and I went to Yandina to celebrate my birthday at the Thai restaurant, mum was sick several times; both en route there and back, and while at the restaurant.  She was unable to take on food and was for the most part either dry retching or retching up liquid bile.

After some discussion we resolved that the most likely cause was the strong pain killers that mum had first taken the night before (i.e., 15Jan26) and that morning.  The movement in the car served to initiate the gag/vomit response.  Mum checked the packagig of these pain-killers later in the day after rest and found that they did, in fact, contain morphine.

## Electrodry arrive to start carpet, furniture and AC clean.

A 'young man' arrived this morning (17Jan26) to perform the deep clean of carpets in all bedrooms and the lounge.  Also clean AC's in lounge and main bedroom.  Also cleanse 2 x lounge seats.  When I spoke with mum this morning he was working on AC's and it was too early to say if he was doing a good job.  She said he was of school age which is a little alarming!

## Final Electrodry Invoice

The following is the final invoice from Electrodry.  Last minute added 2 x chairs on front porch I was unaware of before I emailed Electrodry to explain ~$100 discrepency.  Mum and Bryson both seem happy with the results.  Now we just need Desh to provide letter confirming mym is scabies free.
