Ana from Smart Solutions - Physiotherapy/OT/Speech etc.
(Contracted to Silverchain)

Need to call Kendra Silverchain re agreement (see later in post).

Mum has raised and large dark bruise on right lower forearm.  Occurred in the last 24hrs.  Anna checked.  It is painful to touch.  When first noticed considered taking a knife to it as it was also noticaby rasied. My advice to mum was there is no condition you will experience where taking a knife to it is the solution.

Break?  Spider bite?  Scorpion bite?  Snake bite? Seems, after some Googling, that most likely broken blood vessels under skin common in elderly. Perhaps a bump in the night mum forgot about or didn't even notice?

Not having the same pain and inability to return to bed after midnight wake ups.

Silverchain sending someone from 7Jan26 to do housework for 1.5hrs (per week? don't know where this intel came from so cannot verify).

Ana had mum perform a number of exercises and took notes (stand up and sit several times, stay standing for 15secs…)

Mum sais doing exercises using elastic band left by other physio (from Gympie?) - cannot verify.

Bryson was present during the visit.

I called **Kendra** at Silverchain to sort out agreement.  Agreement is in effect already, since apx mid December ‘25.  Was not aware of home help arrangement so couold not ask Kendra to confirm.

Bed reimbursement may not be possible but Kendra will take up with Kirsten.  It is **Kirsten** who calls the shots and is snr to Kendra.  Kirsten had done a docusearch and found no clearance of scabies from GP.  This will have to happen before any visits from Silverchain.

There appears to be a pattern of avoidance so far from Silverchain to do anything but gatekeep the AgedCare money.  Worth monitoring going forward.
