Confirms mum is now Home Care Package Lvl 3, apx $42k
(apx $25k or 60% approved for provider services immediately)

The letter details that mum is now at Level 3 for Aged Care Home Care Package.  This information has been shared with mum's health care provider - Silverchain.

## Ana from Silverchain is also visiting :woman_health_worker:.

Not sure what the reasoning is behind this but I will be present and hope to see Silverchain provide the support mum needs.  Mum re-tells a story of speaking with Silverchain (Helen?) and being told she could not claim any support $ for the cost of the mechanical bed we bought.

This seems contrary to the whole point of having a provider there to help support a person with thier greatest neds.  This bed represents sid support at it's core (i.e., back injury, hip injury, rest & comfort).

Will be good to get Silverchain's side of the story.

> [!NOTE]
> This is [later confirmed]({{< relref "posts/kirsty-phone-darrell-05jan26.md" >}}) to be the case in my first phone conversation with Kirsty from Silverchain. The prescribed method is to have an OT visit then submit two quotes for the item to MAC and then, if approved, have the provider make the purchase using MAC available funds.
