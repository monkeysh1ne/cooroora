## Letter from Aged Care dated 9Dec25

Confirms mum is now Home Care Package Lvl 3, apx $45k
(apx $25k or 60% approved for provider services immediately)

The letter details that mum is now at Level 3 for Aged Care Home Care Package.  This information has been shared with mum's health care provider.

## Anna from Silverchain is also visiting.

DateTime: Fri, 2nd Jan 2026 11:45.

Not sure what the reasoning is behind this but I will be present and hope to see Silverchain provide the support mum needs.  Mum retels a story of speaking with Silverchain (Helen?) and being told she could not claim any support $ for the cost of the mechanical bed we bought.

This seems contrary to the whole point of having a provider there to help support a person with thier greatest neds.  This bed represents sid support at it's core (i.e., back injury, hip injury, rest & comfort).

Will be good to get Silverchain's side of the story.
