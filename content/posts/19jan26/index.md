Spoke with mum on the phone today.  Has yet to start using new mechanical bed for fear she still has scabies.  I suggested that given the amount of pills and lotions she has applied I had a positive feeling that she was fast approaching being clear.  All that will then be needed is for Desh to issue required letter.  This will be a great releif to mum as she has said (and I have felt) she is feeling very weary from all theat has happened lately especially with the scabies.

We also touched breifly on mum's mortality.  There was no sadness just the quiet agreement and acceptance from us both that every day [at mum's age] is a gift and we must se it as such.  I would just like mum to have a break from all these afflictions and accidents etc if only for a few short months.  Surely she deserves a break from all that entails?

Kirsten had called mum yesterday and confirmed that the home help has been postponed because of scabies infection.  Kirsten also was going to send **me** a form for Evelyn to fill in to get reimbursed for the cleaning that she does for mum.  Mum suspects, and I agree, that if this requires Evelyn to have an ABN then this endeavour will die a quick death.
 At mum's behest I have agreed to come by her's tomorow and do some banking stuff and 'computer stuff' [and just enjoy hanging out time].  She is happy to pay 2 x weeks rent for me as my earnings have taken a big hit these last two weeks due to feck knows what.
