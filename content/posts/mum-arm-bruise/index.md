### What's going on with this bruise on mum's forearm?

It has now been 10 days and the bruise is now extending around the arm.  It is a purple blue black on the top but a more faded green on the underside. There is still a slightly raised centre and it is tender to the touch.  It is also warmer than the surrounding skin (infection? - my note)  Checked with pharmacist in Cooroy Sat morning and she provided a cooling cream which will help reduce bruising.  Mum's last visit to Desh his advice was it was nothing to worry about :smirk: :roll_eyes:
