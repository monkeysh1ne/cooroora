In the interests of going in eyes wide open I feel some time spent planning is in order apropo my retirement.  First up I'll look at costs and realities of buying a caravan in Australia. I'll then look at the same scenario in New Zealand.  The caravan option is the only one short of council flat/appartment or retirement home.  I hope to be in rugged health into my seventies so this option will hopefully hold out as the best for independence and mobility.

Some pre-requisites...
- must be towable by a sedan (e.g., Mitsubishi Lancer) so ATM cannot exceed brake towing limit of 1000kg.
- initial budget is $AU25k including onroad costs (rego, stamp duty etc)
- ideally should include AirCon/Heating and toilet/shower.
- should be available in Sunshine Coast or within 100km from Amamoor, QLD.

The [Venus 11ft Caravan](https://centurytrailers.com.au/product/venus11_caravan/) by CCT (Coopers Caravans) is the first off the rank.  Yesssss it still has the ChatGPT referal in the URL - call me lazy.  OK, at $AU 32,298 it's quite a bit over budget.  It **does** however tick all of the boxes for including AC, including all onroad costs, available withi 100km but does **not** come within the ATM limit of 1000kg (ATM 1500kg).
