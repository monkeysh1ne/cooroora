Bryson and I picked out a bed from Maroochydore Lakeside Mobility along with matterss, side protector and rolling pivoting table for mum.  Will be delivered in first week of Jan 26.  Paid in full today via bank xfer.

Tipped double room mattress over for mum as interim measure until has own bed installed.

Phone message left by Meals on Wheels saying they attempted to deliver food parcels but no-one home.  Tried calling back but no answer.


[13Jan26]Had a call from Wayne at Lakeside Mobility Gympie asking if delivery of bed okay 14Jan26 afternoon?  Called mum and BJ and called Wayne back to say yes algood.  Helped Bryson remove mattres from room as he had alread removed the bed.  Wayne will do all install and show how to use bed.  Woohoo!!
