Sprayed mattress and bed today with 2.5L mix of David Grays Bayer Coopex Insecticide.

Doesn't mention mites in particular but hey, no harm in case it does work or its fleas or bed bugs joining in to make new rashes on my chest.  I've also hung the rug outside over the railing and will leave it there for a couple of days (hopefully without rain!).

Hope to have the energy to mop the floor with bleach tomorrow.
