This information has been shared with mum\u0026rsquo;s health care provider.\nAnna from Silverchain is also visiting. # DateTime: Fri, 2nd Jan 2026 11:45.\nDarrell\u0026rsquo;s Google Calendar showing visit event.\nNot sure what the reasoning is behind this but I will be present and hope to see Silverchain provide the support mum needs. Mum retels a story of speaking with Silverchain (Helen?) and being told she could not claim any support $ for the cost of the mechanical bed we bought.\nThis seems contrary to the whole point of having a provider there to help support a person with thier greatest neds. This bed represents sid support at it\u0026rsquo;s core (i.e., back injury, hip injury, rest \u0026amp; comfort).\nWill be good to get Silverchain\u0026rsquo;s side of the story.\n","date":"31 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/aged-care-mum-level-up/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Aged care mum level up \u0026 Anna from silverchain visit.","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"31 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/agedcare/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Agedcare","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"31 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/financial/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Financial","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"31 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/mum-sickness/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mum Sickness","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"31 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/post/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Post","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"31 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"31 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/silverchain/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Silverchain","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"31 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/mow/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"MoW","type":"tags"},{"content":"So spent most of day with mum and Bryson. Both went down for nap after 12-12:30pm lunch. Was thinking to clean main toilet floor couldn\u0026rsquo;t find spray bottle of disinfectant. Mum\u0026rsquo;s bedroom door ajar and saw it on walker tray. Wondered why but thought nothing more and didn\u0026rsquo;t want to disturb.\nShort while later mum cam into lounge where I was on computer with spray bottle still on walker. I asked why. She said she had sprayed her bed with it. I exclaimed that this was not a product you should be spraying on your bed. Read through warnings and clearly stated skin irritant, keep clear of eyes and mouth. Asked mun if she had read the bottle - no, only saw that it killed 99% of germs.\nI changed mum\u0026rsquo;s sheet and sniffed pillows - no descernable odor of bleach. Put bleach dosed sheet in laundry.\nI explained to Bryson before I left what had happened and that I was concerned that if mum could do this what next? He will place remaining chemicals etc beyond her reach. Very concerned here that mum is becoming incapable of looking after herslef and may well be putting herself in harms way/ heightened risk.\nCalled sis and discussed. Call GP soonest as another cognitive test may be best next step. If GP won\u0026rsquo;t listen to me then maybe POA needs to get involved - see where that gets us (personaly, suspect nowhere). Neither can feed themselves and not entirely sure meds being taken in correct order at correct times.\nMum sounds like she may have been re-infected with scabaies. Suggested call in carpet clearer guy and have entire house done plus upholstery. Remove mattress and burn or otherwise destroy/remove from property.\n","date":"25 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/mum-disinfects-bed/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Mum Disinfects Bed","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"25 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/scuh/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"SCUH","type":"tags"},{"content":" Bryson and I picked out a bed from Maroochydore Lakeside Mobility along with matterss, side protector and rolling pivoting table for mum.

Mum did - and sharted.\nMum cannot be released home if no-one is home. I said I can\u0026rsquo;t be there as place infested.
