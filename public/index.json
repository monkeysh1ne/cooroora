My advice to mum was there is no condition you will experience where taking a knife to it is the solution.\nBreak? Spider bite? Scorpion bite? Snake bite?

She said she had sprayed her bed with it. I exclaimed that this was not a product you should be spraying on your bed.

Asked mun if she had read the bottle - no, only saw that it killed 99% of germs.\nI changed mum\u0026rsquo;s sheet and sniffed pillows - no descernable odor of bleach. Put bleach dosed sheet in laundry.\nI explained to Bryson before I left what had happened and that I was concerned that if mum could do this what next? He will place remaining chemicals etc beyond her reach. Very concerned here that mum is becoming incapable of looking after herslef and may well be putting herself in harms way/ heightened risk.\nCalled sis and discussed. Call GP soonest as another cognitive test may be best next step. If GP won\u0026rsquo;t listen to me then maybe POA needs to get involved - see where that gets us (personaly, suspect nowhere).
