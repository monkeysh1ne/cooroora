I had once again promoted the idea gently to both mum and BJ today and have received a more positive response. Maybe the time has come for getting a few things done at Cooroora to provide a higher level of safety and care for mum. No more sleeping half the night in shared bed then awakeing in small hours in pain and finishing rest of night sat in lounge dozing or fully awake. Then sleeping during the day.\nSome indicative prices and product examples:\nJannali Bed # Alivio Jannali Bed King Single - Lakeside Mobility indicative price at Country Care Group KCare Alivio Jannali Bed\nComfort Lift # Comfort Lift from Bedside Electric Comfort Lift\nMattress # The subtly named \u0026lsquo;Hospital Ultimate Mattress\u0026rsquo; is available through Lakeside Mobility\n","date":"20 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/hugo/cooroora/posts/mechanical-bed-for-mum/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Mechanical Bed for Mum","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"20 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/hugo/cooroora/tags/mechanical-beds/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mechanical Beds","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/hugo/cooroora/tags/mobility-aids/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mobility Aids","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"16 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/hugo/cooroora/tags/phone/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Phone","type":"tags"},{"content":" Kendra called - no arrangement made for visit only that Kirsty was AVAILABLE 161225.
